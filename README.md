**MAPPING INDIA'S URBANISATION (Urban Growth in India)**

The data here shows the distribution of built-up area, Settlement and population
for four time periods: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014 along with Nighttime Light
data.

Folder contains data on: Administrative division (2001_District_Census and
2011_District_Census), Electoral Boundaries (Assembly and Parliamentary
Constituency), Nightlights (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and
Infrastructure (Highways) and Urban Settlement (Built-up area, Settlement
cluster and Population cluster) layers

**Temporal resolution**: Built-up: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014; Population: 1975,
1990, 2000 and 2015 and Night Light: 1992, 2000 and 2013.

**Spatial resolution**: Built-up: 38 meter; Population: 250 meter and Night
Light: 463.05 meter

**\#\#\#Dataset sources:**

1.  **GHSL** - The Global Human Settlement (GHS) framework produces global
    spatial information about the human presence on the planet over time. The
    spatial data here shows the distribution of built-up area and population for
    four time periods: 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2014. The built-up and population
    layer data has been extracted from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL),
    see [link](http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) for more information.

2.  **VIIRS** - Earth Observations Group (EOG) at NOAA/NGDC is producing a
    version 1 VIIRS suite of average radiance composite images using nighttime
    data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night
    Band (DNB).
    See [link](https://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/viirs/download_dnb_composites.html) for
    more information.

3.  **Assembly and Parliamentary Constituency**- The Lok Sabha, the lower house
    of the Parliament of India, is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs). Each
    MP, represents a single geographic constituency. See [link](
    https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/data/2674065)for more information.

**File format**: The zip file contains Administrative division
(2001_District_Census and 2011_District_Census), Electoral Boundaries (Assembly
and Parliamentary Constituency), Nightlights (Visible Infrared Imaging
Radiometer Suite), Infrastructure (Highways) in Shapefile format and Urban
Settlement (Built-up area, Settlement cluster and Population cluster) in Geotiff
format.
